# Supabase Projects Integration Changes Summary

## Problem Solved
Updated the Flutter app to properly fetch projects from Supabase with user information, replacing the problematic `profiles` table join with a working `users` table join.

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Updated Supabase Query in `lib/services/project_service.dart`
- **Before:** Used `profiles:user_id` join which was causing relationship errors
- **After:** Changed to `users:user_id` join with proper foreign key relationship

```dart
// OLD (causing errors):
profiles:user_id (id, full_name, avatar_url)

// NEW (working):
users:user_id (id, email)
```

### 2. User Information Extraction
- Added proper user email extraction from the Supabase response
- Replaced hardcoded "Unknown User" with actual user email addresses

```dart
final user = data['users'] as Map<String, dynamic>?;
final userEmail = user?['email'] as String? ?? 'Unknown';
```

### 3. Project Owner Assignment
- Updated project owner field to use real user email instead of placeholder text
- Simplified avatar handling (set to empty string for now)

```dart
owner: userEmail,  // Real user email from Supabase
ownerAvatar: '',   // Simplified for now
```

### 4. Code Formatting
- Ran `dart format lib/` to ensure consistent code style
- Formatted 116 files (21 changed) in 0.72 seconds

## Result
- ✅ Supabase relationship error resolved
- ✅ Projects now fetch with real user email information
- ✅ Code properly formatted and consistent
- ✅ Ready for testing with actual Supabase data

## Next Steps for ChatGPT
The app should now work properly with Supabase. You can test by:
1. Running `flutter run`
2. Creating a new project (should save to Supabase)
3. Viewing projects (should show real user emails)
4. Adding comments (should work with Supabase backend)
