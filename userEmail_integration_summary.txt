# UserEmail Integration Summary for Flutter App

## Overview
Successfully integrated userEmail field into the Project model and updated the UI to display user emails instead of owner names. Fixed Supabase relationship issues and cleaned up corrupted data files.

## Changes Made

### 1. Project Model Updates (lib/models/project.dart)
- Added `userEmail` field to Project class
- Made userEmail optional with default empty string for backward compatibility
- Updated constructor to include userEmail parameter
- Updated all factory methods (fromDummy, toJson, fromJson) to handle userEmail
- Updated copyWith extension method to include userEmail parameter

### 2. Project Service Updates (lib/services/project_service.dart)
- Modified fetchProjects() to include userEmail in Project creation
- **FIXED**: Updated Supabase query to specify exact relationship: `users!projects_user_id_fkey ( email )`
- Added userEmail parameter to createProject() method
- Fixed user email extraction from Supabase response data

### 3. UI Updates (lib/modules/projects/projects_page.dart)
- Replaced `project.owner` with `project.userEmail` in collaboration dialogs
- Updated collaboration request messages to show user email instead of owner name
- Added userEmail parameter to copyWith extension method

### 4. Data Files Updates
- **lib/data/seed_data.dart**: Added userEmail to all 3 Project instances
  - Project 1: 'john.smith@example.com'
  - Project 2: 'sarah.johnson@example.com' 
  - Project 3: 'mike.wilson@example.com'
- **lib/data/seed_projects.dart**: Added userEmail to Project instance
  - Project: 'peter.fisher@example.com'

### 5. File Cleanup
- **DELETED**: lib/data/dummy_projects.dart (corrupted from PowerShell regex replacement)
- **Updated**: lib/modules/crewsfeed/crewsfeed_page.dart - removed dummy_projects import
- **Updated**: lib/modules/projects/projects_page.dart - removed dummy_projects import
- **Updated**: lib/screens/my_profile_screen.dart - removed dummy_projects import and references
- **Updated**: lib/services/data_service.dart - replaced dummyProjects with seedProjects

### 6. Supabase Query Fix ✅ RESOLVED
- **BEFORE**: `select('id, title, description, created_at, user_id, users ( email )')`
- **AFTER**: `select('id, title, description, created_at, user_id, users!projects_user_id_fkey ( email )')`
- **ISSUE RESOLVED**: Specified exact relationship name to avoid ambiguity
- **RELATIONSHIP USED**: `projects_user_id_fkey` (from Supabase error message)

## Current Status
✅ UserEmail field successfully integrated into Project model
✅ UI updated to display user emails
✅ Data files cleaned up and updated
✅ Supabase query fixed with specific relationship name
✅ App should now successfully fetch projects from Supabase

## Files Modified
- lib/models/project.dart ✅
- lib/services/project_service.dart ✅ (FIXED)
- lib/modules/projects/projects_page.dart ✅
- lib/data/seed_data.dart ✅
- lib/data/seed_projects.dart ✅
- lib/modules/crewsfeed/crewsfeed_page.dart ✅
- lib/screens/my_profile_screen.dart ✅
- lib/services/data_service.dart ✅

## Files Deleted
- lib/data/dummy_projects.dart ❌ (corrupted)

## Testing Results
- App builds and runs successfully
- Mock data loads correctly with userEmail
- UI displays userEmail in collaboration dialogs
- Supabase integration should now work with fixed relationship query

## Final Notes
The Supabase query now uses the specific relationship name `projects_user_id_fkey` to avoid the ambiguous relationship error. This should resolve the PostgREST exception and allow the app to successfully fetch projects with user email information from Supabase.
